Transcript from [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zPc2xjVpCY):)

A: Love is a funny thing. They say the heart wants what the heart wants. But I think it should be. The limbic system wants what the limibic system wants.

B: Finally, someone's making sense.

A: Well, not to brag, but when it comes to unrequited love, I'm kind of an expert.

B: When I talk to Paige, all she does is drive me crazy.

A: There's a thin line between affection and aggravation. The Roman poet Catullus said, I hate and I love. And I know not. Why?

B: I'm not sure what to make of that.

A: Perhaps it would be more useful in Latin. Odetta, Mo.

B: I just want to know if I have a crush.

A: Well, does your heart rate elevate when you're in her presence?

B: I suppose. 

A: Does your stomach flutter?

B: Yes.

A: Sounds like your limbic system might be doing its thing.

B: Oh, dear.
