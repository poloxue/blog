A: John Sturgis.

B: Hey, John.

A: Connie. So nice to hear from you.

B: You'll never guess what I'm doing.

A: Tell me.

B: I am working on a solar neutrino detector.

A: Wow. I was going to guess making soft boiled eggs.

B: Ha, ha. Yeah. Sheldon and Linklater asked me to help him out.

A: Oh. Linklater's involved.

B: He's not so bad.

A: You and he aren't.

B: Oh, no, no, no. I'm still seeing Dale.

A: Okay, good. I can handle you with a guy who sells volleyballs, but you with another scientist. It'd be like a dagger in the heart.

B: No daggers here.

A: So tell me about this experiment.

B: Well, I don't know if you know this, but solar neutrinos are like little messengers from the center of the sun.

A: I did know that, But it's delightful to hear you say it.

B: Well, enjoy. Cause that's about all I remember. So what's new about you?

A: Well, let's see. Oh, yesterday I had my first breakfast burrito. 

B: Oh. Good for you. How was it?

A: Confusing. I ordinarily have burritos for lunch or dinner.

B: I don't know how to respond to that.

A: You're working on an experiment, and I'm eating dinner for breakfast. It's a crazy world.
