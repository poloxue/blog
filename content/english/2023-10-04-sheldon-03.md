Transcript from [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zPc2xjVpCY):

A: It's a lot of fabric.

B: Oh, it's not just fabric. I also got pattern books and an accessory kit.

A: Can I ask how much that all cost?

B: Well, it's hard to say, because in the long run, I'm going to save us money.

A: Well, what did it cost in the short run?

B: I don't know. $100.

A: $100? What is wrong with you?

C: Why would you say that?

A: That is a good question.

C: I mean, what is wrong with you?

A: Why is it okay when you say it?

C: Because clearly there's something wrong with you. 

A: So you think it's fine that she spent $100 on threads?

C: I think it's fine that she has something that makes her happy.

A: What are you looking for? Anybody with you?

C: Look, I get it. One time, Darlene got all into scrapbooking overnight. Our den became her scrapbooking room.

A: What did you do?

C: I said whatever makes you happy, dear, and made love to her in the scrapbooking room. Mm hm.

A: Maybe if you had three kids, you'd worry more about money. 

C: Oh, we can't wait to have babies. I just love the way the little head smell. 

A: Does anybody in here want to be my friend? Anybody?
